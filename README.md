# Advanced-Image-Captioning-and-Object-Detection-with-Florence-2

This project demonstrates the capabilities of the Florence-2 vision model from Microsoft. It showcases various computer vision tasks including image captioning, detailed description generation, and object detection. The Florence-2 model is a powerful, versatile tool for understanding and analyzing image content.

## Features

1. **Image Captioning**: Generate concise, accurate captions for images.
2. **Detailed Description Generation**: Create comprehensive, paragraph-long descriptions of image content.
3. **Object Detection**: Identify and locate multiple objects within images.
4. **Guided Object Detection**: Focus on specific objects as requested by the user.
## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Transformers library
- Accelerate
- Flash-Attention
- einops
- timm
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

  
## Installation

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/nxveenx/Advanced-Image-Captioning-and-Object-Detection-with-Florence-2.git

cd Advanced-Image-Captioning-and-Object-Detection-with-Florence-2

    
## Troubleshooting

If you encounter CUDA out-of-memory errors, try reducing the batch size or using a smaller model variant.

Ensure that you have the latest versions of the required libraries installed.
